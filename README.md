#Photo Sort

Simple Scala script that sorts photos into a date based directory structure.

Just a little utility I use to help keep track of photos.


#Usage

Expects the following directory structure...

`DROPBOX_HOME/photo_script` - the directory this project is in

`DROPBOX_HOME/shared_photos` - the directory that the source photos are in

`DROPBOX_HOME/sorted_photos` - the directory that the photos are copied to in sorted order

Using the command line `cd DROPBOX_HOME/photo_script` and then `sbt run`
